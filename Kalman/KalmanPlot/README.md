# KalmanPlot

A simple C# Windows Forms app for testing the simplified Kalman filter. Generates a random walk signal, adds noise to simulate an inaccurately measured signal, then feeds the measured signal into the filter. Results are plotted on a line chart.

The simplified version of the Kalman Filter works on scalar values only, and doesn't take into account the state transition model or the control-input model
